# Bachelor's Thesis in Mathematics: Automatic Differentiation: Fundamentals, Implementation and Applications

## Description
Automatic Differentiation is a key technique in numerical optimization, machine learning, and scientific computing. Unlike symbolic or numerical differentiation, AD provides exact derivatives efficiently. This project builds an AD engine from the ground up using custom Python classes that overload arithmetic operations to track and propagate derivatives.
